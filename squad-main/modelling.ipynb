      " context: In linear algebra, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (named after the mathematicians Arthur Cayley and William Rowan Hamilton) states that every square matrix over a commutative ring (such as the real or complex field) satisfies its own characteristic equation. If is a given nxn matrix and In is the nxn identity matrix, then the characteristic polynomial of is defined as det where det is the determinant operation and is a variable for a scalar element of the base ring. Since the entries of the matrix are (linear or constant) polynomials in l, the determinant is also an n-th order monic polynomial in l, One can create an analogous polynomial in the matrix instead of the scalar variable l, defined as The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that this polynomial results in the zero matrix, which is to say that The theorem allows An to be expressed as a linear combination of the lower matrix powers of A. When the ring is a field, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is equivalent to the statement that the minimal polynomial of a square matrix divides its characteristic polynomial. The theorem was first proved in 1853 in terms of inverses of linear functions of quaternions, a non-commutative ring, by Hamilton. This corresponds to the special case of certain real or complex matrices. The theorem holds for general quaternionic matrices. Cayley in 1858 stated it for and smaller matrices, but only published a proof for the case. The general case was first proved by Ferdinand Frobenius in 1878., \n",

This relationship of direct proportion can be written as: So this means: or where:V is the volume of the gas, is the temperature of the gas (measured in kelvins), and is a non-zero constant. This law describes how a gas expands as the temperature increases; conversely, a decrease in temperature will lead to a decrease in volume.

Then the number of sets in is less than or equal to the binomial coefficient The result is part of the theory of hypergraphs. family of sets may also be called a hypergraph, and when all the sets (which are called \"hyperedges\" in this context) are the same size r, it is called an r-uniform hypergraph. The theorem thus gives an upper bound for the number of pairwise non-disjoint hyperedges in an r-uniform hypergraph with vertices and 2r. The theorem may also be formulated in terms of graph theory: the independence number of the Kneser graph KGn,r for 2r is \\alpha According to Erdos (1987) the theorem was proved in 1938, but was not published until 1961 in an apparently more general form.

      " context: In arithmetic combinatorics, the Erdos-Szemeredi theorem, proven by Paul Erdos and Endre Szemeredi in 1983, states that, for every finite set of real numbers, at least one of the set of pairwise sums or the set of pairwise products of the numbers in the original set form a significantly larger set. More precisely, it asserts the existence of positive constants and \\varepsilon such that max whenever is a finite non-empty set of real numbers of cardinality |A|, where is the sum-set of with itself, and It is possible for to be of comparable size to if is an arithmetic progression, and it is possible for to be of comparable size to if is a geometric progression. The Erdos-Szemeredi theorem can thus be viewed as an assertion that it is not possible for a large set to behave like an arithmetic progression and as a geometric progression simultaneously. It can also be viewed as an assertion that the real line does not contain any set resembling a finite subring or finite subfield; it is the first example of what is now known as the sum-product phenomenon, which is now known to hold in a wide variety of rings and fields, including finite fields.It was conjectured by Erdos and Szemeredi that one can take \\varepsilon arbitrarily close to 1. The best result in this direction currently is by George Shakan, who showed that one can take \\varepsilon arbitrarily close to 5277 Previously, Misha Rudnev, Ilya Shkredov, and Sophie Stevens had shown that one can take \\varepsilon arbitrarily close to 1509 improving an earlier result by Jozsef Solymosi, who had shown that one can take it arbitrarily close to, \n",

In its basic form, the test assumes that there are no parameters to be estimated in the distribution being tested, in which case the test and its set of critical values is distribution-free. However, the test is most often used in contexts where a family of distributions is being tested, in which case the parameters of that family need to be estimated and account must be taken of this in adjusting either the test-statistic or its critical values. When applied to testing whether a normal distribution adequately describes a set of data, it is one of the most powerful statistical tools for detecting most departures from normality.K-sample Anderson-Darling tests are available for testing whether several collections of observations can be modelled as coming from a single population, where the distribution function does not have to be specified. In addition to its use as a test of fit for distributions, it can be used in parameter estimation as the basis for a form of minimum distance estimation procedure.

      "question: Who discovered a model of interacting spins on a crystalline lattice., \n",
      " context: In statistical mechanics, the Potts model, a generalization of the Ising model, is a model of interacting spins on a crystalline lattice. By studying the Potts model, one may gain insight into the behaviour of ferromagnets and certain other phenomena of solid-state physics. The strength of the Potts model is not so much that it models these physical systems well; it is rather that the one-dimensional case is exactly solvable, and that it has a rich mathematical formulation that has been studied extensively. The model is named after Renfrey Potts, who described the model near the end of his 1951 Ph.D. thesis. The model was related to the \"planar Potts\" or \"clock model\", which was suggested to him by his advisor, Cyril Domb. The four-state planar Potts model is sometimes known as the Ashkin-Teller model, after Julius Ashkin and Edward Teller, who considered an equivalent model in 1943. The Potts model is related to, and generalized by, several other models, including the XY model, the Heisenberg model and the N-vector model. The infinite-range Potts model is known as the Kac model. When the spins are taken to interact in a non-Abelian manner, the model is related to the flux tube model, which is used to discuss confinement in quantum chromodynamics. Generalizations of the Potts model have also been used to model grain growth in metals and coarsening in foams. further generalization of these methods by James Glazier and Francois Graner, known as the cellular Potts model, has been used to simulate static and kinetic phenomena in foam and biological morphogenesis., \n",

      " context: In organic chemistry, the Baker-Nathan effect is observed with reaction rates for certain chemical reactions with certain substrates where the order in reactivity cannot be explained solely by an inductive effect of substituents.This effect was described in 1935 by John W. Baker and W. S. Nathan. They examined the chemical kinetics for the reaction of pyridine with benzyl bromide and with a range of benzyl bromides with different para alkyl substituents (reaction product a pyridinium salt). The reaction is facilitated by electron-releasing substituents (the inductive effect) and in general the observed order (with decreasing reactivity) is tert-butyl isopropyl ethyl methyl. The observed order in this particular reaction however was methyl ethyl> isopropyl tert-butyl. In 1935 Baker and Nathan explained the observed difference in terms of a conjugation effect and in later years after the advent of hyperconjugation (1939) as its predecessor. fundamental problem with the effect is that differences in the observed order are relatively small and therefore difficult to measure accurately. Other researchers have found similar results or very different results. An alternative explanation for the effect is differential solvation as orders invert on going from the solution phase to the gas phase., \n",

Employing a nucleophilic catalyst, such as a tertiary amine and phosphine, this reaction provides a densely functionalized product (e.g. functionalized allyl alcohol in the case of aldehyde as the electrophile). It is named for Anthony B. Baylis and Melville E. D. Hillman, two of the chemists who developed this reaction while working at Celanese.

DABCO is one of the most frequently used tertiary amine catalysts for this reaction. In addition, nucleophilic amines such as DMAP and DBU as well as phosphines have been found to successfully catalyze this reaction. MBH reaction has several advantages as a useful synthetic method: 1) It is an atom-economic coupling of easily prepared starting materials. 2) Reaction of a pro-chiral electrophile generates a chiral center, therefore an asymmetric synthesis is possible. 3) Reaction products usually contain multiple functionalities in a proximity so that a variety of further transformations are possible. 4) It can employ a nucleophilic organo-catalytic system without the use of heavy metal under mild conditions.

      "question: Who discovered a change in hue perception as light intensity changes., \n",
      " context: The Bezold-Brucke shift or luminance-on-hue effect is a change in hue perception as light intensity changes. As intensity increases, spectral colors shift more towards blue (if below 500 nm) or yellow (if above 500 nm). At lower intensities, the red/green axis dominates. This means that the Reds become Yellower with increasing brightness. Light may change in the perceived hue as its brightness changes, despite the fact that it retains a constant spectral composition. It was discovered by Wilhelm von Bezold and M.E. Brucke. The shift in the hue of the colors that occur as the intensity of the corresponding energy change is materially increased, except in some cases like the change for certain invariable hues (approximating the psychologically primary hues). Both Bezold Brucke worked on the Bezold-Brucke effect and gave important contributions in the field of optical illusions.This effect is a problem for simple HSV-style color models, which treat hue and intensity as independent parameters. In contrast, color appearance models try to factor in this effect. The shift in the hue is also accompanied by the changes in the perceived saturation. As the brightness of the color stimuli increases, their color strength also increases to a maximum point and then decreases again; in such a way that it is still wavelength specific. This can, to an extent, be considered as an inverse of the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect. In the case of the Helmholtz Kohlrausch effect, the partially desaturated stimulus is seen to be brighter than fully saturated or achromatic stimulus., \n",

      " context: The Biefeld-Brown effect is an electrical phenomenon that produces an ionic wind that transfers its momentum to surrounding neutral particles. It describes a force observed on an asymmetric capacitor when high voltage is applied to the capacitor's electrodes. Once suitably charged up to high DC potentials, a thrust at the negative terminal, pushing it away from the positive terminal, is generated. The effect was named by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown who claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy Paul Alfred Biefeld, a former teacher of Brown whom Brown claimed was his mentor and co-experimenter at Denison University in Ohio.The use of an asymmetric capacitor, with the negative electrode being larger than the positive electrode, allowed for more thrust to be produced in the direction from the low-flux to the high-flux region compared to a conventional capacitor. These asymmetric capacitors became known as Asymmetrical Capacitor Thrusters (ACT). The Biefeld-Brown effect can be observed in ionocrafts and lifters, which utilize the effect to produce thrust in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts.In his 1960 patent titled \"Electrokinetic Apparatus,\" Brown refers to electrokinesis to describe the Biefeld-Brown effect, linking the phenomenon to the field of electrohydrodynamics (EHD). Brown also believed the Biefeld-Brown effect could produce an anti-gravity force, referred to as \"electrogravitics\" based on it being an electricity/gravity phenomenon.

      " context: In quantum chemistry and molecular physics, the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is the best known mathematical approximation in molecular dynamics. Specifically, it is the assumption that the wave functions of atomic nuclei and electrons in a molecule can be treated separately, based on the fact that the nuclei are much heavier than the electrons. The approach is named after Max Born and J. Robert Oppenheimer who proposed it in 1927, in the early period of quantum mechanics. The approximation is widely used in quantum chemistry to speed up the computation of molecular wavefunctions and other properties for large molecules. There are cases where the assumption of separable motion no longer holds, which make the approximation lose validity (it is said to \"break down\"), but is then often used as a starting point for more refined methods. In molecular spectroscopy, using the BO approximation means considering molecular energy as a sum of independent terms, e.g.: total electronic vibrational rotational nuclear spin These terms are of different orders of magnitude and the nuclear spin energy is so small that it is often omitted. The electronic energies electronic consist of kinetic energies, interelectronic repulsions, internuclear repulsions, and electron-nuclear attractions, which are the terms typically included when computing the electronic structure of molecules., \n",

      " context: The Compton-Getting effect is an apparent anisotropy in the intensity of radiation or particles due to the relative motion between the observer and the source. This effect was first identified in the intensity of cosmic rays by Arthur Compton and Ivan A. Getting in 1935. Gleeson and Axford provide a full derivation of the equations relevant to this effect.The original application of the Compton-Getting effect predicted that the intensity of cosmic rays should be higher coming from the direction in which Earth is moving. For the case of cosmic rays the Compton-Getting effect only applies to those that are unaffected by the Solar wind such as extremely high energy rays. It has been calculated that the speed of the Earth within the galaxy (200 kilometres per second (120 mi/s)) would result in a difference between the strongest and weakest cosmic ray intensities of about 0.1%. This small difference is within the capabilities of modern instruments to detect, and was observed in 1986. Forman (1970) derives the Compton-Getting effect anisotropy from the Lorentz invariance of the phase space distribution function. Ipavich (1974) furthers this general derivation to derive count rates with respect to the flow vector.This Compton-Getting effect is apparent in plasma data in Earth's magnetotail. The Compton-Getting effect has also been utilized for analyzing energetic neutral atom (ENA) data returned by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft at Saturn., \n",

It states that, for a reaction that has a pair of reactive intermediates or reactants that interconvert rapidly (as is usually the case for conformational isomers), each going irreversibly to a different product, the product ratio will depend both on the difference in energy between the two conformers and the energy barriers from each of the rapidly equilibrating isomers to their respective products. Stated another way, the product distribution reflects the difference in energy between the two rate-limiting transition states. As a result, the product distribution will not necessarily reflect the equilibrium distribution of the two intermediates.

The Damerau-Levenshtein distance differs from the classical Levenshtein distance by including transpositions among its allowable operations in addition to the three classical single-character edit operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions).In his seminal paper, Damerau stated that in an investigation of spelling errors for an information-retrieval system, more than 80% were a result of a single error of one of the four types. Damerau's paper considered only misspellings that could be corrected with at most one edit operation. While the original motivation was to measure distance between human misspellings to improve applications such as spell checkers, Damerau-Levenshtein distance has also seen uses in biology to measure the variation between protein sequences., \n",

The reaction uses a hypervalent iodine reagent similar to IBX to selectively and mildly oxidize alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. The reaction is commonly conducted in chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane or chloroform. The reaction can be done at room temperature and is quickly complete. Many other functional groups will not be affected by this reaction. The Dess-Martin oxidation may be preferable to other oxidation reactions as it is very mild, avoids the use of toxic chromium reagents, does not require large excess or co-oxidants, and for its ease of work up. The reaction produces two equivalents of acetic acid. It can be buffered with pyridine or sodium bicarbonate in order to protect acid-labile compounds.

      "question: Who discovered a chemical reaction between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene, commonly termed the dienophile, to form a substituted cyclohexene derivative., \n",
      " context: In organic chemistry, the Diels-Alder reaction is a chemical reaction between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene, commonly termed the dienophile, to form a substituted cyclohexene derivative. It is the prototypical example of a pericyclic reaction with a concerted mechanism. More specifically, it is classified as a thermally-allowed [4+2] cycloaddition with Woodward-Hoffmann symbol [p4s p2s]. It was first described by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928. For the discovery of this reaction, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950. Through the simultaneous construction of two new carbon-carbon bonds, the Diels-Alder reaction provides a reliable way to form six-membered rings with good control over the regio- and stereochemical outcomes. Consequently, it has served as a powerful and widely applied tool for the introduction of chemical complexity in the synthesis of natural products and new materials. The underlying concept has also been applied to p-systems involving heteroatoms, such as carbonyls and imines, which furnish the corresponding heterocycles; this variant is known as the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. The reaction has also been generalized to other ring sizes, although none of these generalizations have matched the formation of six-membered rings in terms of scope or versatility. Because of the negative values of DHdeg and DSdeg for a typical Diels-Alder reaction, the microscopic reverse of a Diels-Alder reaction becomes favorable at high temperatures, although this is of synthetic importance for only a limited range of Diels-Alder adducts, generally with some special structural features; this reverse reaction is known as the retro-Diels-Alder reaction., \n",

      " context: The Dulong-Petit law, a thermodynamic law proposed in 1819 by French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Therese Petit, states the classical expression for the molar specific heat capacity of certain chemical elements. Experimentally the two scientists had found that the heat capacity per weight (the mass-specific heat capacity) for a number of elements was close to a constant value, after it had been multiplied by a number representing the presumed relative atomic weight of the element. These atomic weights had shortly before been suggested by John Dalton and modified by Jacob Berzelius. In modern terms, Dulong and Petit found that the heat capacity of a mole of many solid elements is about 3R, where is the modern constant called the universal gas constant. Dulong and Petit were unaware of the relationship with R, since this constant had not yet been defined from the later kinetic theory of gases. The value of 3R is about 25 joules per kelvin, and Dulong and Petit essentially found that this was the heat capacity of certain solid elements per mole of atoms they contained. The modern theory of the heat capacity of solids states that it is due to lattice vibrations in the solid and was first derived in crude form from this assumption by Albert Einstein in 1907. The Einstein solid model thus gave for the first time a reason why the Dulong-Petit law should be stated in terms of the classical heat capacities for gases., \n",

It is inspired by the Dyson sphere, but much harder to detect from another star system.The concept for the so-called Dyson-Harrop satellite begins with a long metal wire loop pointed at the sun. This wire is charged to generate a cylindrical magnetic field that snags the electrons that make up half the solar wind. These electrons get funnelled into a metal spherical receiver to produce a current, which generates the wire's magnetic field making the system self-sustaining. Any current not needed for the magnetic field powers an infrared laser trained on satellite dishes back on Earth, designed to collect the energy. Earth's air does not absorb infra-red light, so the system would be highly efficient. Back on the satellite, the current has been drained of its electrical energy by the laser the electrons fall onto a ring-shaped sail, where incoming sunlight can excite them enough to keep the satellite in orbit around the sun.A relatively small Dyson-Harrop satellite using a 1-centimetre-wide copper wire 300 metres long, a receiver metres wide and a sail 10 metres in diameter, sitting at roughly the same distance from the sun as the Earth, could generate 1.7 megawatts of power enough for about 1000 family homes in the US.

      " context: In economics, an Edgeworth box, sometimes referred to as an Edgeworth-Bowley box, is a graphical representation of a market with just two commodities, and Y, and two consumers. The dimensions of the box are the total quantities Ox and Oy of the two goods. Let the consumers be Octavio and Abby. The top right-hand corner of the box represents the allocation in which Octavio holds all the goods, while the bottom left corresponds to complete ownership by Abby. Points within the box represent ways of allocating the goods between the two consumers. Market behaviour will be determined by the consumers' indifference curves. The blue curves in the diagram represent indifference curves for Octavio, and are shown as convex from his viewpoint (i.e. seen from the bottom left). The orange curves apply to Abby, and are convex as seen from the top right. Moving up and to the right increases Octavio's allocation and puts him onto a more desirable indifference curve while placing Abby onto a less desirable one. Convex indifference curves are considered to be the usual case. They correspond to diminishing returns for each good relative to the other. Exchange within the market starts from an initial allocation known as an endowment. The main use of the Edgeworth box is to introduce topics in general equilibrium theory in a form in which properties can be visualised graphically. It can also show the difficulty of moving to an efficient outcome in the presence of bilateral monopoly. In the latter case, it serves as a precursor to the bargaining problem of game theory that allows a unique numerical solution., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a stereoelectronic effect that describes the tendency of heteroatomic substituents adjacent to a heteroatom within a cyclohexane ring to prefer the axial orientation instead of the less hindered equatorial orientation that would be expected from steric considerations., \n",
      " context: In organic chemistry, the anomeric effect or Edward-Lemieux effect is a stereoelectronic effect that describes the tendency of heteroatomic substituents adjacent to a heteroatom within a cyclohexane ring to prefer the axial orientation instead of the less hindered equatorial orientation that would be expected from steric considerations. This effect was originally observed in pyranose rings by J. T. Edward in 1955 when studying carbohydrate chemistry. The term anomeric effect was introduced in 1958. The name comes from the term used to designate the lowest-numbered ring carbon of a pyranose, the anomeric carbon. Isomers that differ only in the configuration at the anomeric carbon are called anomers. The anomers of D-glucopyranose are diastereomers, with the beta anomer having an OH group pointing up equatorially, and the alpha anomer having that OH group pointing down axially. The anomeric effect can also be generalized to any cyclohexyl or linear system with the general formula C-Y-C-X, where is a heteroatom with one or more lone pairs, and is an electronegative atom or group. The magnitude of the anomeric effect is estimated at about 1-2 kcal/mol in the case of sugars, but is different for every molecule. In the above case, the methoxy group on the cyclohexane ring (top) prefers the equatorial position. However, in the tetrahydropyran ring (bottom), the methoxy group prefers the axial position. This is because in the cyclohexane ring, Y= carbon, which is not a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect is not observed and sterics dominates the observed substituent position. In the tetrahydropyran ring, Y= oxygen, which is a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect contributes and stabilizes the observed substituent position. In both cases, X= OMe. The anomeric effect is most often observed when Y= oxygen, but can also be seen with other lone pair bearing heteroatoms in the ring, such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The exact method by which the anomeric effect causes stabilization is a point of controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain it., \n",

The effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum. It is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials. The experimental observation and accurate measurement of the effect demonstrated that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment (polarization) of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization. These measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization: that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons. The effect also demonstrated the close relation between the notions of angular momentum in classical and in quantum physics. The effect was predicted by O. W. Richardson in 1908.

It is named for Peter D. T. A. Elliott and Heini Halberstam, who stated the conjecture in 1968.Stating the conjecture requires some notation. Let \\pi the prime counting function, denote the number of primes less than or equal to If is a positive integer and a is coprime to we let \\pi denote the number of primes less than or equal to which are equal to a modulo Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions then tells us that \\pi where \\varphi is Euler's totient function.

I. Vinogradov (the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem, sometimes known simply as \"Bombieri's theorem\"); this result is already quite useful, being an averaged form of the generalized Riemann hypothesis. It is known that the conjecture fails at the endpoint \\theta .The Elliott-Halberstam conjecture has several consequences. One striking one is the result announced by Dan Goldston, Janos Pintz, and Cem Yildirim, which shows (assuming this conjecture) that there are infinitely many pairs of primes which differ by at most 16. In November 2013, James Maynard showed that subject to the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture, one can show the existence of infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by at most 12. In August 2014, Polymath group showed that subject to the generalized Elliott-Halberstam conjecture, one can show the existence of infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by at most 6.

      " context: In quantum statistics, a branch of physics, Fermi-Dirac statistics describe a distribution of particles over energy states in systems consisting of many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. It is named after Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac, each of whom discovered the method independently (although Fermi defined the statistics earlier than Dirac).Fermi-Dirac (F-D) statistics apply to identical particles with half-integer spin in a system with thermodynamic equilibrium. Additionally, the particles in this system are assumed to have negligible mutual interaction. That allows the multi-particle system to be described in terms of single-particle energy states. The result is the F-D distribution of particles over these states which includes the condition that no two particles can occupy the same state; this has a considerable effect on the properties of the system. Since F-D statistics apply to particles with half-integer spin, these particles have come to be called fermions. It is most commonly applied to electrons, a type of fermion with spin 1/2. Fermi-Dirac statistics are a part of the more general field of statistical mechanics and use the principles of quantum mechanics. The counterpart to F-D statistics is the Bose-Einstein statistics, that apply to bosons (full integer spin, such as photons, or no spin, like the Higgs boson), particles that do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that more than one boson can take up the same quantum configuration simultaneously., \n",

      " context: The Franz-Keldysh effect is a change in optical absorption by a semiconductor when an electric field is applied. The effect is named after the German physicist Walter Franz and Russian physicist Leonid Keldysh (nephew of Mstislav Keldysh). Karl W. Boer observed first the shift of the optical absorption edge with electric fields during the discovery of high-field domains and named this the Franz-effect. few months later, when the English translation of the Keldysh paper became available, he corrected this to the Franz-Keldysh effect.As originally conceived, the Franz-Keldysh effect is the result of wavefunctions \"leaking\" into the band gap. When an electric field is applied, the electron and hole wavefunctions become Airy functions rather than plane waves. The Airy function includes a \"tail\" which extends into the classically forbidden band gap. According to Fermi's golden rule, the more overlap there is between the wavefunctions of a free electron and a hole, the stronger the optical absorption will be. The Airy tails slightly overlap even if the electron and hole are at slightly different potentials (slightly different physical locations along the field). The absorption spectrum now includes a tail at energies below the band gap and some oscillations above it. This explanation does, however, omit the effects of excitons, which may dominate optical properties near the band gap. The Franz-Keldysh effect occurs in uniform, bulk semiconductors, unlike the quantum-confined Stark effect, which requires a quantum well. Both are used for electro-absorption modulators. The Franz-Keldysh effect usually requires hundreds of volts, limiting its usefulness with conventional electronics although this is not the case for commercially available Franz-Keldysh-effect electro-absorption modulators that use a waveguide geometry to guide the optical carrier., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a name for the behaviour of charged particles near a semi-permeable membrane that sometimes fail to distribute evenly across the two sides of the membrane.  , \n",
      " context: The Gibbs-Donnan effect (also known as the Donnan's effect, Donnan law, Donnan equilibrium, or Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium) is a name for the behaviour of charged particles near a semi-permeable membrane that sometimes fail to distribute evenly across the two sides of the membrane. The usual cause is the presence of a different charged substance that is unable to pass through the membrane and thus creates an uneven electrical charge. For example, the large anionic proteins in blood plasma are not permeable to capillary walls. Because small cations are attracted, but are not bound to the proteins, small anions will cross capillary walls away from the anionic proteins more readily than small cations. Thus, some ionic species can pass through the barrier while others cannot. The solutions may be gels or colloids as well as solutions of electrolytes, and as such the phase boundary between gels, or a gel and a liquid, can also act as a selective barrier. The electric potential arising between two such solutions is called the Donnan potential. The effect is named after the American physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs who proposed it in 1878 and the British chemist Frederick G. Donnan who studied it experimentally in 1911.The Donnan equilibrium is prominent in the triphasic model for articular cartilage proposed by Mow and Lai, as well as in electrochemical fuel cells and dialysis. The Donnan effect is tactic pressure attributable to cations (Na+ and K+) attached to dissolved plasma proteins., \n",

The shift is perpendicular to the direction of propagation in the plane containing the incident and reflected beams. This effect is the linear polarization analog of the Imbert-Fedorov effect. This effect occurs because the reflections of a finite sized beam will interfere along a line transverse to the average propagation direction. As shown in the figure, the superposition of two plane waves with slightly different angles of incidence but with the same frequency or wavelength is given by \\mathbf \\mathbf \\mathbf where cos sin \\mathbf \\theta \\theta and cos sin \\mathbf \\theta \\theta with .It can be shown that the two waves generate an interference pattern transverse to the average propagation direction, cos sin \\mathbf and on the interface along the plane. Both waves are reflected from the surface and undergo different phase shifts, which leads to a lateral shift of the finite beam. Therefore, the Goos-Hanchen effect is a coherence phenomenon. This effect continues to be a topic of scientific research, for example in the context of nanophotonics applications. negative Goos-Hanchen shift was shown by Wild and Giles. Sensitive detection of biological molecules is achieved based on measuring the Goos-Hanchen shift, where the signal of lateral change is in a linear relation with the concentration of target molecules. The work by Merano et al. studied the Goos-Hanchen effect experimentally for the case of an optical beam reflecting from a metal surface (gold) at 826 nm.

These invariants have been used to distinguish symplectic manifolds that were previously indistinguishable. They also play a crucial role in closed type IIA string theory.

In biology, he is known for the Hardy-Weinberg principle, a basic principle of population genetics. G. H. Hardy is usually known by those outside the field of mathematics for his 1940 essay Mathematician's Apology, often considered one of the best insights into the mind of a working mathematician written for the layperson. Starting in 1914, Hardy was the mentor of the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, a relationship that has become celebrated. Hardy almost immediately recognised Ramanujan's extraordinary albeit untutored brilliance, and Hardy and Ramanujan became close collaborators. In an interview by Paul Erdos, when Hardy was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, Hardy unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of Ramanujan. In a lecture on Ramanujan, Hardy said that \"my association with him is the one romantic incident in my life\"., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a theorem that states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences.  , \n",
      " context: In population genetics, the Hardy-Weinberg principle, also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, model, theorem, or law, states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. These influences include genetic drift, mate choice, assortative mating, natural selection, sexual selection, mutation, gene flow, meiotic drive, genetic hitchhiking, population bottleneck, founder effect and inbreeding. In the simplest case of a single locus with two alleles denoted and a with frequencies f(A) and f(a) q, respectively, the expected genotype frequencies under random mating are f(AA) p2 for the AA homozygotes, f(aa) q2 for the aa homozygotes, and f(Aa) 2pq for the heterozygotes. In the absence of selection, mutation, genetic drift, or other forces, allele frequencies and are constant between generations, so equilibrium is reached. The principle is named after G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg, who first demonstrated it mathematically. Hardy's paper was focused on debunking the view that a dominant allele would automatically tend to increase in frequency (a view possibly based on a misinterpreted question at a lecture). Today, tests for Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies are used primarily to test for population stratification and other forms of non-random mating., \n",

      "question: Who discovered bright patches of nebulosity associated with newborn stars., \n",
      " context: Herbig-Haro (HH) objects are bright patches of nebulosity associated with newborn stars. They are formed when narrow jets of partially ionised gas ejected by stars collide with nearby clouds of gas and dust at several hundred kilometres per second. Herbig-Haro objects are commonly found in star-forming regions, and several are often seen around a single star, aligned with its rotational axis. Most of them lie within about one parsec (3.26 light-years) of the source, although some have been observed several parsecs away. HH objects are transient phenomena that last around a few tens of thousands of years. They can change visibly over timescales of a few years as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds of interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM). Hubble Space Telescope observations have revealed the complex evolution of HH objects over the period of a few years, as parts of the nebula fade while others brighten as they collide with the clumpy material of the interstellar medium. First observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, Herbig-Haro objects were recognised as a distinct type of emission nebula in the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed the objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process. Although HH objects are a visible wavelength phenomena, many remain invisible at these wavelengths due to dust and gas, and can only be detected at infrared wavelengths. Such objects, when observed in near infrared, are called molecular hydrogen emission-line objects (MHOs)., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a device that uses an electric field to heat ions to nuclear fusion conditions.  , \n",
      " context: fusor is a device that uses an electric field to heat ions to nuclear fusion conditions. The machine induces a voltage between two metal cages, inside a vacuum. Positive ions fall down this voltage drop, building up speed. If they collide in the center, they can fuse. This is one kind of an inertial electrostatic confinement device branch of fusion research. Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor is the most common type of fusor. This design came from work by Philo T. Farnsworth in 1964 and Robert L. Hirsch in 1967. variant type of fusor had been proposed previously by William Elmore, James L. Tuck, and Ken Watson at the Los Alamos National Laboratory though they never built the machine. Fusors have been built by various institutions. These include academic institutions such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and government entities, such as the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority. Fusors have also been developed commercially, as sources for neutrons by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and as a method for generating medical isotopes. Fusors have also become very popular for hobbyists and amateurs. growing number of amateurs have performed nuclear fusion using simple fusor machines. However, fusors are not considered a viable concept for large-scale energy production by scientists., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a theory of quantum gravity proposed by Petr Horava in 2009., \n",
      " context: Horava-Lifshitz gravity (or Horava gravity) is a theory of quantum gravity proposed by Petr Horava in 2009. It solves the problem of different concepts of time in quantum field theory and general relativity by treating the quantum concept as the more fundamental so that space and time are not equivalent (anisotropic) at high energy level. The relativistic concept of time with its Lorentz invariance emerges at large distances. The theory relies on the theory of foliations to produce its causal structure. It is related to topologically massive gravity and the Cotton tensor. It is a possible UV completion of general relativity. Also, the speed of light goes to infinity at high energies. The novelty of this approach, compared to previous approaches to quantum gravity such as Loop quantum gravity, is that it uses concepts from condensed matter physics such as quantum critical phenomena. Horava's initial formulation was found to have side-effects such as predicting very different results for a spherical Sun compared to a slightly non-spherical Sun, so others have modified the theory. Inconsistencies remain. However progress has been made on the theory., \n",

      " context: In statistics, the Jarque-Bera test is a goodness-of-fit test of whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The test is named after Carlos Jarque and Anil K. Bera. The test statistic is always nonnegative. If it is far from zero, it signals the data do not have a normal distribution. The test statistic JB is defined as where is the number of observations (or degrees of freedom in general); is the sample skewness, is the sample kurtosis where and are the estimates of third and fourth central moments, respectively, is the sample mean, and is the estimate of the second central moment, the variance. If the data comes from a normal distribution, the JB statistic asymptotically has a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom, so the statistic can be used to test the hypothesis that the data are from a normal distribution. The null hypothesis is a joint hypothesis of the skewness being zero and the excess kurtosis being zero. Samples from a normal distribution have an expected skewness of and an expected excess kurtosis of (which is the same as a kurtosis of 3). As the definition of JB shows, any deviation from this increases the JB statistic. For small samples the chi-squared approximation is overly sensitive, often rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Furthermore, the distribution of p-values departs from a uniform distribution and becomes a right-skewed unimodal distribution, especially for small p-values. This leads to a large Type error rate. The table below shows some p-values approximated by a chi-squared distribution that differ from their true alpha levels for small samples. (These values have been approximated using Monte Carlo simulation in Matlab) In MATLAB's implementation, the chi-squared approximation for the JB statistic's distribution is only used for large sample sizes (> 2000). For smaller samples, it uses a table derived from Monte Carlo simulations in order to interpolate p-values., \n",

Thermal noise is present in all electrical circuits, and in sensitive electronic equipment such as radio receivers can drown out weak signals, and can be the limiting factor on sensitivity of an electrical measuring instrument. Thermal noise increases with temperature. Some sensitive electronic equipment such as radio telescope receivers are cooled to cryogenic temperatures to reduce thermal noise in their circuits. The generic, statistical physical derivation of this noise is called the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, where generalized impedance or generalized susceptibility is used to characterize the medium. Thermal noise in an ideal resistor is approximately white, meaning that the power spectral density is nearly constant throughout the frequency spectrum (however see the section below on extremely high frequencies).

This procedure is called a throttling process or Joule-Thomson process. At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium, and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule-Thomson process when being throttled through an orifice; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures. Most liquids such as hydraulic oils will be warmed by the Joule-Thomson throttling process. The gas-cooling throttling process is commonly exploited in refrigeration processes such as air conditioners, heat pumps, and liquefiers. In hydraulics, the warming effect from Joule-Thomson throttling can be used to find internally leaking valves as these will produce heat which can be detected by thermocouple or thermal-imaging camera. Throttling is a fundamentally irreversible process. The throttling due to the flow resistance in supply lines, heat exchangers, regenerators, and other components of (thermal) machines is a source of losses that limits the performance., \n",

      "question: Who discovered an astronomical process that occurs when the surface of a star or a planet cools., \n",
      " context: The Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism is an astronomical process that occurs when the surface of a star or a planet cools. The cooling causes the internal pressure to drop, and the star or planet shrinks as a result. This compression, in turn, heats the core of the star/planet. This mechanism is evident on Jupiter and Saturn and on brown dwarfs whose central temperatures are not high enough to undergo hydrogen fusion. It is estimated that Jupiter radiates more energy through this mechanism than it receives from the Sun, but Saturn might not. The latter process causes Jupiter to shrink at a rate of two centimetres each year. Nevertheless in the second edition of his book in 2009, Patrick Irwin gives a shrinking of only mm/year, a value corresponding to an internal flux of 7.485 W/m2 (a figure given by Liming Li et al.), instead of 150 W/m2, corresponding to cm/year, a clearly too high value. The mechanism was originally proposed by Kelvin and Helmholtz in the late nineteenth century to explain the source of energy of the Sun. By the mid-nineteenth century, conservation of energy had been accepted, and one consequence of this law of physics is that the Sun must have some energy source to continue to shine. Because nuclear reactions were unknown, the main candidate for the source of solar energy was gravitational contraction. However, it soon was recognized by Sir Arthur Eddington and others that the total amount of energy available through this mechanism only allowed the Sun to shine for millions of years rather than the billions of years that the geological and biological evidence suggested for the age of the Earth. (Kelvin himself had argued that the Earth was millions, not billions, of years old.) The true source of the Sun's energy remained uncertain until the 1930s, when it was shown by Hans Bethe to be nuclear fusion., \n",

      " context: In thermodynamics, the Joule-Thomson effect (also known as the Joule-Kelvin effect or Kelvin-Joule effect) describes the temperature change of a real gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while keeping it insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment. This procedure is called a throttling process or Joule-Thomson process. At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium, and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule-Thomson process when being throttled through an orifice; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures. Most liquids such as hydraulic oils will be warmed by the Joule-Thomson throttling process. The gas-cooling throttling process is commonly exploited in refrigeration processes such as air conditioners, heat pumps, and liquefiers. In hydraulics, the warming effect from Joule-Thomson throttling can be used to find internally leaking valves as these will produce heat which can be detected by thermocouple or thermal-imaging camera. Throttling is a fundamentally irreversible process. The throttling due to the flow resistance in supply lines, heat exchangers, regenerators, and other components of (thermal) machines is a source of losses that limits the performance., \n",

Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside, is a layer of ionised gas occurring roughly between 90km and 150 km (56 and 93 mi) above the ground one of several layers in the Earth's ionosphere. It is also known as the region. It reflects medium-frequency radio waves. Because of this reflective layer, radio waves radiated into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon. This \"skywave\" or \"skip\" propagation technique has been used since the 1920s for radio communication at long distances, up to transcontinental distances. Propagation is affected by the time of day. During the daytime the solar wind presses this layer closer to the Earth, thereby limiting how far it can reflect radio waves. Conversely, on the night (lee) side of the Earth, the solar wind drags the ionosphere further away, thereby greatly increasing the range which radio waves can travel by reflection. The extent of the effect is further influenced by the season, and the amount of sunspot activity., \n",

The relation was first examined by Maarten Schmidt in a 1959 paper where he proposed that the SFR surface density scales as some positive power of the local gas surface density. i.e. \\Sigma .In general, the SFR surface density is in units of solar masses per year per square parsec yr pc and the gas surface density in grams per square parsec pc Using an analysis of gaseous helium and young stars in the solar neighborhood, the local density of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the local helium density, Schmidt suggested a value of (and very likely between and 3). All of the data used were gathered from the Milky Way, and specifically the solar-neighborhood. In 1998, Robert Kennicutt found that the \\alpha intensities of every galaxy in a sample of could be fit with the Schmidt law. More recently, he examined the connection between gas density and SFR for nearly 100 nearby galaxies to estimate a value of 1.4 0.15, \n",

      "question: Who discovered a relativistic wave equation, related to the Schrodinger equation., \n",
      " context: The Klein-Gordon equation (Klein-Fock-Gordon equation or sometimes Klein-Gordon-Fock equation) is a relativistic wave equation, related to the Schrodinger equation. It is second-order in space and time and manifestly Lorentz-covariant. It is a quantized version of the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Its solutions include a quantum scalar or pseudoscalar field, a field whose quanta are spinless particles. Its theoretical relevance is similar to that of the Dirac equation. Electromagnetic interactions can be incorporated, forming the topic of scalar electrodynamics, but because common spinless particles like the pions are unstable and also experience the strong interaction (with unknown interaction term in the Hamiltonian,) the practical utility is limited. The equation can be put into the form of a Schrodinger equation. In this form it is expressed as two coupled differential equations, each of first order in time. The solutions have two components, reflecting the charge degree of freedom in relativity. It admits a conserved quantity, but this is not positive definite. The wave function cannot therefore be interpreted as a probability amplitude. The conserved quantity is instead interpreted as electric charge, and the norm squared of the wave function is interpreted as a charge density. The equation describes all spinless particles with positive, negative, and zero charge. Any solution of the free Dirac equation is, for each of its four components, a solution of the free Klein-Gordon equation. The Klein-Gordon equation does not form the basis of a consistent quantum relativistic one-particle theory. There is no known such theory for particles of any spin. For full reconciliation of quantum mechanics with special relativity, quantum field theory is needed, in which the Klein-Gordon equation reemerges as the equation obeyed by the components of all free quantum fields. In quantum field theory, the solutions of the free (noninteracting) versions of the original equations still play a role. They are needed to build the Hilbert space (Fock space) and to express quantum fields by using complete sets (spanning sets of Hilbert space) of wave functions., \n",

The formula, giving the probability of a diabatic (not adiabatic) transition between the two energy states, was published separately by Lev Landau, Clarence Zener, Ernst Stueckelberg, and Ettore Majorana, in 1932. If the system starts, in the infinite past, in the lower energy eigenstate, we wish to calculate the probability of finding the system in the upper energy eigenstate in the infinite future (a so-called Landau-Zener transition). For infinitely slow variation of the energy difference (that is, a Landau-Zener velocity of zero), the adiabatic theorem tells us that no such transition will take place, as the system will always be in an instantaneous eigenstate of the Hamiltonian at that moment in time. At non-zero velocities, transitions occur with probability as described by the Landau-Zener formula., \n",

This thickness is accurate because the thickness of each monolayer is known and can therefore be added to find the total thickness of a Langmuir-Blodgett film. The monolayers are assembled vertically and are usually composed either of amphiphilic molecules (see Chemical polarity) with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail (example: fatty acids) or nowadays commonly of nanoparticles.Langmuir-Blodgett films are named after Irving Langmuir and Katharine B. Blodgett, who invented this technique while working in Research and Development for General Electric Co., \n",

It is a gravitomagnetic frame-dragging effect. It is a prediction of general relativity consisting of secular precessions of the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of pericenter of a test particle freely orbiting a central spinning mass endowed with angular momentum The difference between de Sitter precession and the Lense-Thirring effect is that the de Sitter effect is due simply to the presence of a central mass, whereas the Lense-Thirring effect is due to the rotation of the central mass. The total precession is calculated by combining the de Sitter precession with the Lense-Thirring precession.

      " context: The Leonard-Merritt mass estimator is a formula for estimating the mass of a spherical stellar system using the apparent (angular) positions and proper motions of its component stars. The distance to the stellar system must also be known. Like the virial theorem, the Leonard-Merritt estimator yields correct results regardless of the degree of velocity anisotropy. Its statistical properties are superior to those of the virial theorem. However, it requires that two components of the velocity be known for every star, rather than just one for the virial theorem.The estimator has the general form 16 \\langle \\over The angle brackets denote averages over the ensemble of observed stars. is the mass contained within a distance from the center of the stellar system; is the projected distance of a star from the apparent center; and are the components of a star's velocity parallel to, and perpendicular to, the apparent radius vector; and is the gravitational constant. Like all estimators based on moments of the Jeans equations, the Leonard-Merritt estimator requires an assumption about the relative distribution of mass and light. As a result, it is most useful when applied to stellar systems that have one of two properties: All or almost all of the mass resides in a central object, or, the mass is distributed in the same way as the observed stars.Case (1) applies to the nucleus of a galaxy containing a supermassive black hole. Case (2) applies to a stellar system composed entirely of luminous stars (i.e. no dark matter or black holes). In a cluster with constant mass-to-light ratio and total mass the Leonard-Merritt estimator becomes: 32 \\over On the other hand, if all the mass is located in a central point of mass then: 16 \\over In its second form, the Leonard-Merritt estimator has been successfully used to measure the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, \n",

In this case, there are no charged currents in the solid, so the magnetic field cannot exert a Lorentz force.

      " context: An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.The artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's transfer function., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a mathematical model (see yield surface) describing the response of brittle materials such as concrete, or rubble piles, to shear stress as well as normal stress., \n",
      " context: Mohr-Coulomb theory is a mathematical model (see yield surface) describing the response of brittle materials such as concrete, or rubble piles, to shear stress as well as normal stress. Most of the classical engineering materials somehow follow this rule in at least a portion of their shear failure envelope. Generally the theory applies to materials for which the compressive strength far exceeds the tensile strength.In geotechnical engineering it is used to define shear strength of soils and rocks at different effective stresses. In structural engineering it is used to determine failure load as well as the angle of fracture of a displacement fracture in concrete and similar materials. Coulomb's friction hypothesis is used to determine the combination of shear and normal stress that will cause a fracture of the material. Mohr's circle is used to determine which principal stresses will produce this combination of shear and normal stress, and the angle of the plane in which this will occur. According to the principle of normality the stress introduced at failure will be perpendicular to the line describing the fracture condition. It can be shown that a material failing according to Coulomb's friction hypothesis will show the displacement introduced at failure forming an angle to the line of fracture equal to the angle of friction. This makes the strength of the material determinable by comparing the external mechanical work introduced by the displacement and the external load with the internal mechanical work introduced by the strain and stress at the line of failure. By conservation of energy the sum of these must be zero and this will make it possible to calculate the failure load of the construction. common improvement of this model is to combine Coulomb's friction hypothesis with Rankine's principal stress hypothesis to describe a separation fracture., \n",

      "question: Who discovered  bosons that appear necessarily in models exhibiting spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries., \n",
      " context: In particle and condensed matter physics, Goldstone bosons or Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) are bosons that appear necessarily in models exhibiting spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries. They were discovered by Yoichiro Nambu in particle physics within the context of the BCS superconductivity mechanism, and subsequently elucidated by Jeffrey Goldstone, and systematically generalized in the context of quantum field theory. In condensed matter physics such bosons are quasiparticles and are known as Anderson-Bogoliubov modes.These spinless bosons correspond to the spontaneously broken internal symmetry generators, and are characterized by the quantum numbers of these. They transform nonlinearly (shift) under the action of these generators, and can thus be excited out of the asymmetric vacuum by these generators. Thus, they can be thought of as the excitations of the field in the broken symmetry directions in group space--and are massless if the spontaneously broken symmetry is not also broken explicitly. If, instead, the symmetry is not exact, i.e. if it is explicitly broken as well as spontaneously broken, then the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are not massless, though they typically remain relatively light; they are then called pseudo-Goldstone bosons or pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (abbreviated PNGBs)., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a theorem in the field of signal processing which serves as a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals., \n",
      " context: The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is a theorem in the field of signal processing which serves as a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth. Strictly speaking, the theorem only applies to a class of mathematical functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or sample rate) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces the concept of a sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are band-limited to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process. It expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples. Perfect reconstruction may still be possible when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied, provided other constraints on the signal are known (see Sampling of non-baseband signals below and compressed sensing). In some cases (when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied), utilizing additional constraints allows for approximate reconstructions. The fidelity of these reconstructions can be verified and quantified utilizing Bochner's theorem.The name Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem honours Harry Nyquist and Claude Shannon, but the theorem was also previously discovered by E. T. Whittaker (published in 1915) and Shannon cited Whittaker's paper in his work. It was also discovered in 1933 by Vladimir Kotelnikov. The theorem is thus also known by the names Whittaker-Shannon sampling theorem, Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov, Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov, and Whittaker-Nyquist-Kotelnikov-Shannon, and may also be referred to as the cardinal theorem of interpolation., \n",

Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as governed by the selection rules. Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of magnetic field strength, this effect can be used to measure magnetic field strength, e.g. that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas. The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Mossbauer spectroscopy.

Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan and Raphael Salem continued their study in the 1940s. Salem numbers are a closely related set of numbers. characteristic property of PV numbers is that their powers approach integers at an exponential rate. Pisot proved a remarkable converse: if is a real number such that the sequence measuring the distance from its consecutive powers to the nearest integer is square-summable, or 2, then is a Pisot number (and, in particular, algebraic). Building on this characterization of PV numbers, Salem showed that the set of all PV numbers is closed. Its minimal element is a cubic irrationality known as the plastic number. Much is known about the accumulation points of S. The smallest of them is the golden ratio., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a model of interacting spins on a crystalline lattice., \n",
      " context: In statistical mechanics, the Potts model, a generalization of the Ising model, is a model of interacting spins on a crystalline lattice. By studying the Potts model, one may gain insight into the behaviour of ferromagnets and certain other phenomena of solid-state physics. The strength of the Potts model is not so much that it models these physical systems well; it is rather that the one-dimensional case is exactly solvable, and that it has a rich mathematical formulation that has been studied extensively. The model is named after Renfrey Potts, who described the model near the end of his 1951 Ph.D. thesis. The model was related to the \"planar Potts\" or \"clock model\", which was suggested to him by his advisor, Cyril Domb. The four-state planar Potts model is sometimes known as the Ashkin-Teller model, after Julius Ashkin and Edward Teller, who considered an equivalent model in 1943. The Potts model is related to, and generalized by, several other models, including the XY model, the Heisenberg model and the N-vector model. The infinite-range Potts model is known as the Kac model. When the spins are taken to interact in a non-Abelian manner, the model is related to the flux tube model, which is used to discuss confinement in quantum chromodynamics. Generalizations of the Potts model have also been used to model grain growth in metals and coarsening in foams. further generalization of these methods by James Glazier and Francois Graner, known as the cellular Potts model, has been used to simulate static and kinetic phenomena in foam and biological morphogenesis., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a process by which solar radiation causes a dust grain orbiting a star to lose angular momentum relative to its orbit around the star.  , \n",
      " context: The Poynting-Robertson effect, also known as Poynting-Robertson drag, named after John Henry Poynting and Howard P. Robertson, is a process by which solar radiation causes a dust grain orbiting a star to lose angular momentum relative to its orbit around the star. This is related to radiation pressure tangential to the grain's motion. This causes dust that is small enough to be affected by this drag, but too large to be blown away from the star by radiation pressure, to spiral slowly into the star. In the case of the Solar System, this can be thought of as affecting dust grains from mm to mm in diameter. Larger dust is likely to collide with another object long before such drag can have an effect. Poynting initially gave a description of the effect in 1903 based on the luminiferous aether theory, which was superseded by the theories of relativity in 1905-1915. In 1937 Robertson described the effect in terms of general relativity., \n",

      " context: The Rescorla-Wagner model (\"R-W\") is a model of classical conditioning, in which learning is conceptualized in terms of associations between conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli. strong CS-US association means, essentially, that the CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US, but after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. The model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials, during which stimuli may be either present or absent. The strength of prediction of the US on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all CSs present during the trial. This feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models, and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena, most notably the blocking effect. Failures of the model have led to modifications, alternative models, and many additional findings. The model has had some impact on neural science in recent years, as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal DA projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model.The Rescorla-Wagner model was created by Yale psychologists Robert A.

When a magnetic field is applied, an orthogonal temperature gradient develops. For conductors, a significant portion of the thermal current is carried by the electrons. In particular, the Righi-Leduc effect describes the heat flow resulting from a perpendicular temperature gradient and vice versa, and the Maggi-Righi-Leduc effect describes changes in thermal conductivity when placing a conductor in a magnetic field. thermal Hall effect has also been measured in a paramagnetic insulator and called the \"phonon Hall effect\". In this case, there are no charged currents in the solid, so the magnetic field cannot exert a Lorentz force. An analogous thermal Hall effect for neutral particles exists in polyatomic gases (known as the Senftleben-Beenakker effect).

      " context: The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis the Whorf hypothesis, or Whorfianism, is a principle suggesting that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language. However, the idea did not originate with Edward Sapir or Benjamin Lee Whorf, but rather, was imported from German humanistic thinking by various American authors. Being related to the concept of the spirit or Geist, it is a core tenet of Volkerpsychologie and other versions of post-Hegelian philosophy and German romanticism.The idea is often stated in two forms: the strong hypothesis, now referred to as linguistic determinism, was held by some of the early linguists before World War II, while the weak hypothesis is mostly held by some of the modern linguists. The strong version, or linguistic determinism, says that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories. This version is generally agreed to be false by modern linguists. The weak version says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions.The principle had been accepted and then abandoned by linguists during the early 20th century following the changing perceptions of social acceptance for the other especially after World War II. The origin of formulated arguments against the acceptance of linguistic relativity is attributed to Noam Chomsky.The principle of linguistic relativity and the relation between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from philosophy to psychology and anthropology, and it has also inspired and coloured works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages., \n",

Seiberg-Witten invariants are similar to Donaldson invariants and can be used to prove similar (but sometimes slightly stronger) results about smooth 4-manifolds. They are technically much easier to work with than Donaldson invariants; for example, the moduli spaces of solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations tends to be compact, so one avoids the hard problems involved in compactifying the moduli spaces in Donaldson theory.

      " context: The Senftleben-Beenakker effect is the dependence on a magnetic or electric field of transport properties (such as viscosity and heat conductivity) of polyatomic gases. The effect is caused by the precession of the (magnetic or electric) dipole of the gas molecules between collisions. The resulting rotation of the molecule averages out the nonspherical part of the collision cross-section, if the field is large enough that the precession time is short compared to the time between collisions (this requires a very dilute gas). The change in the collision cross-section, in turn, can be measured as a change in the transport properties. The magnetic field dependence of the transport properties can also include a transverse component; for example, a heat flow perpendicular to both temperature gradient and magnetic field. This is the molecular analogue of the Hall effect and Righi-Leduc effect for electrons. key difference is that the gas molecules are neutral, unlike the electrons, so the magnetic field exerts no Lorentz force. An analogous magnetotransverse heat conductivity has been discovered for photons and phonons.The Senftleben-Beenakker effect owes its name to the physicists Hermann Senftleben (Munster University, Germany) and Jan J.M. Beenakker (nl) (Leiden University, The Netherlands), who discovered it, respectively, for paramagnetic gases (such as NO and O2) and diamagnetic gases (such as N2 and CO). The change in the transport properties is smaller in a diamagnetic gas, because the magnetic moment is not intrinsic (as it is in a paramagnetic gas), but induced by the rotation of a nonspherical molecule. The importance of the effect is that it provides information on the angular dependence of the intermolecular potential. The theory to extract that information from transport measurements is based on the Waldmann-Snider equation (a quantum mechanical version of the Boltzmann equation for gases with rotating molecules).

      "question: Who discovered , for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences., \n",
      " context: The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith-Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. The algorithm was first proposed by Temple F. Smith and Michael S. Waterman in 1981. Like the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, of which it is a variation, Smith-Waterman is a dynamic programming algorithm. As such, it has the desirable property that it is guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment with respect to the scoring system being used (which includes the substitution matrix and the gap-scoring scheme). The main difference to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is that negative scoring matrix cells are set to zero, which renders the (thus positively scoring) local alignments visible. Traceback procedure starts at the highest scoring matrix cell and proceeds until a cell with score zero is encountered, yielding the highest scoring local alignment. Because of its quadratic complexity in time and space, it often cannot be practically applied to large-scale problems and is replaced in favor of less general but computationally more efficient alternatives such as (Gotoh, 1982), (Altschul and Erickson, 1986), and (Myers and Miller, 1988)., \n",

Likewise, the second (doubly ionized) spark spectrum of an element is similar in all details to the first (singly ionized) spark spectrum of the element preceding it, or to the arc (neutral) spectrum of the element with atomic number two less, and so forth.Hence, the spectra of (neutral carbon), II (singly ionized nitrogen), and III (doubly ionized oxygen) atoms are similar, apart from shifts of the spectra to shorter wavelengths. I, II, and III all have the same number of electrons, six, and the same ground-state electron configuration: .The law was discovered by and named after Arnold Sommerfeld and Walther Kossel, who set it forth in a paper submitted to Verhandungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft in early 1919., \n",

      " context: In the visual arts, color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color, and tertiary color. Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490), a tradition of \"colory theory\" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color (Opticks, 1704) and the nature of primary colors. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry and vision science.The purpose of color theory range from renaissance fine art to modern commercial advertising. Colours affect our mood and perception. Color theory is not new but also seen in old traditions. Color was mentioned many times in the ancient bible and every colour has its specific definition and interpretation.Color can be classified according to Warm and Cold Receding and Advancing Positive and negative Subtractive and additive, \n",

It is named after T. Dale Stewart and Richard C. Tolman, two American physicists who carried out their experimental work in the 1910s. This eponym appears to be first used by Lev Landau.In a conducting body undergoing accelerating motion, inertia causes the electrons in the body to \"lag\" behind the overall motion. In the case of linear acceleration, negative charge accumulates at the end of the body; while for rotation the negative charge accumulates at the outer rim. The accumulation of charges can be measured by a galvanometer. This effect is proportional to the mass of the charge carriers. It is much more significant in electrolyte conductors than metals, because ions in the former are 103-104 times more massive than electrons in the latter., \n",

      " context: The solar cycle or solar magnetic activity cycle is a nearly periodic 11-year change in the Sun's activity measured in terms of variations in the number of observed sunspots on the solar surface. Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years; however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years. This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as auroras. Solar activity, driven both by the sunspot cycle and transient aperiodic processes govern the environment of the Solar System planets by creating space weather and impact space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer. Understanding and predicting the sunspot cycle remains one of the grand challenges in astrophysics with major ramifications for space science and the understanding of magnetohydrodynamic phenomena elsewhere in the Universe., \n",

      " context: The Thomas-Fermi (TF) model, named after Llewellyn Thomas and Enrico Fermi, is a quantum mechanical theory for the electronic structure of many-body systems developed semiclassically shortly after the introduction of the Schrodinger equation. It stands separate from wave function theory as being formulated in terms of the electronic density alone and as such is viewed as a precursor to modern density functional theory. The Thomas-Fermi model is correct only in the limit of an infinite nuclear charge. Using the approximation for realistic systems yields poor quantitative predictions, even failing to reproduce some general features of the density such as shell structure in atoms and Friedel oscillations in solids. It has, however, found modern applications in many fields through the ability to extract qualitative trends analytically and with the ease at which the model can be solved. The kinetic energy expression of Thomas-Fermi theory is also used as a component in more sophisticated density approximation to the kinetic energy within modern orbital-free density functional theory. Working independently, Thomas and Fermi used this statistical model in 1927 to approximate the distribution of electrons in an atom. Although electrons are distributed nonuniformly in an atom, an approximation was made that the electrons are distributed uniformly in each small volume element DV (i.e. locally) but the electron density can still vary from one small volume element to the next., \n",

      ", \n",
      " context: The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (or TOV limit) is an upper bound to the mass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars, analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars. Theoretical work in 1996 placed the limit at approximately 1.5 to 3.0 solar masses, corresponding to an original stellar mass of 15 to 20 solar masses; additional work in the same year gave a more precise range of 2.2 to 2.9 solar masses.Observations of GW170817, the first gravitational wave event due to merging neutron stars (which are thought to have collapsed into a black hole within a few seconds after merging), placed the limit at close to 2.17M (solar masses). This value was inconsistent with short gamma-ray burst X-ray plateau data however, which suggested a value of MTOV 2.37M. Reanalysis of the GW170817 event data in 2019 resulted in a higher value of MTOV 2.3M. neutron star in a binary pair (PSR J2215+5135) has been measured to have a mass close to this limit, 2.27+0.17-0.15 M. more secure measurement of PSR J0740+6620, a pulsar being eclipsed by a white dwarf, yields a mass of 2.14+0.10-0.09 M.In the case of a rigidly spinning neutron star, the mass limit is thought to increase by up to 18-20%., \n",

It is used in the study of crystalline materials in solid-state physics. The unique property of a crystal is that its atoms are arranged in a regular three-dimensional array called a lattice. All the properties attributed to crystalline materials stem from this highly ordered structure. Such a structure exhibits discrete translational symmetry. In order to model and study such a periodic system, one needs a mathematical \"handle\" to describe the symmetry and hence draw conclusions about the material properties consequent to this symmetry. The Wigner-Seitz cell is a means to achieve this. Wigner-Seitz cell is an example of a primitive cell, which is a unit cell containing exactly one lattice point. For any given lattice, there are an infinite number of possible primitive cells. However there is only one Wigner-Seitz cell for any given lattice. It is the locus of points in space that are closer to that lattice point than to any of the other lattice points.

      " context: The Woodward-Hoffmann rules (or the pericyclic selection rules), devised by Robert Burns Woodward and Roald Hoffmann, are a set of rules used to rationalize or predict certain aspects of the stereochemistry and activation energy of pericyclic reactions, an important class of reactions in organic chemistry. The rules are best understood in terms of the concept of the conservation of orbital symmetry using orbital correlation diagrams, for which an elementary description is given in Section 10.4 of a student level text book. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules are a consequence of the changes in electronic structure that occur during a pericyclic reaction and are predicated on the phasing of the interacting molecular orbitals. They are applicable to all classes of pericyclic reactions (and their microscopic reverse 'retro' processes), including (1) electrocyclizations, (2) cycloadditions, (3) sigmatropic reactions, (4) group transfer reactions, (5) ene reactions, (6) cheletropic reactions, and (7) dyotropic reactions. Due to their elegance, simplicity, and generality, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules are credited with first exemplifying the power of molecular orbital theory to experimental chemists.Woodward and Hoffmann developed the pericyclic selection rules by examining correlations between reactant and product orbitals (i.e., how reactant and product orbitals are related to each other by continuous geometric distortions that are functions of the reaction coordinate). They identified the conservation of orbital symmetry as a crucial theoretical principle that dictates the outcome (or feasibility) of a pericyclic process. Other theoretical approaches that lead to the same selection rules have also been advanced. Hoffmann was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for elucidating the importance of orbital symmetry in pericyclic reactions, which he shared with Kenichi Fukui. Fukui developed a similar set of ideas within the framework of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory. Because Woodward had died two years before, he was not eligible to win what would have been his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry., \n",

      "question: Who discovered the chemical reaction of an aromatic or vinylic alkoxy pentacarbonyl chromium carbene complex with an alkyne and carbon monoxide to give a Cr(CO)3-coordinated substituted phenol., \n",
      " context: The Wulff-Dotz reaction (also known as the Dotz reaction or the benzannulation reaction of the Fischer carbene complexes) is the chemical reaction of an aromatic or vinylic alkoxy pentacarbonyl chromium carbene complex with an alkyne and carbon monoxide to give a Cr(CO)3-coordinated substituted phenol. Several reviews have been published. It is named after the German chemist Karl Heinz Dotz (b. 1943) and the American chemist William D. Wulff (b. 1949) at Michigan State University. The reaction was first discovered by Karl Dotz and was extensively developed by his group and W. Wulff's group. They subsequently share the name of the reaction. The position of the substituents is highly predictable with the largest alkyne substituent (RL) neighboring the phenol and the smallest alkyne substituent (RS) neighboring the methoxy group. Hence, this reaction is more useful for terminal alkynes than internal alkynes. The phenol can be liberated from the chromium complex by a mild oxidation, such as ceric ammonium nitrate or air oxidation. Since this reaction can quickly generate complex phenolic compounds, the Wulff-Dotz reaction has been used most often in the synthesis of natural products, especially Vitamins and K. It is also applicable to the synthesis of polyphenolic compounds, such as calixarenes., \n",

      " context: Simpson's paradox, which also goes by several other names, is a phenomenon in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics and is particularly problematic when frequency data is unduly given causal interpretations. The paradox can be resolved when causal relations are appropriately addressed in the statistical modeling. It is also referred to as Simpson's reversal, Yule-Simpson effect, amalgamation paradox, or reversal paradox.Simpson's paradox has been used as an exemplar to illustrate to the non-specialist or public audience the kind of misleading results mis-applied statistics can generate. Martin Gardner wrote a popular account of Simpson's paradox in his March 1976 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.Edward H. Simpson first described this phenomenon in a technical paper in 1951, but the statisticians Karl Pearson et al., in 1899, and Udny Yule, in 1903, had mentioned similar effects earlier.

      "question: Who discovered bright patches of nebulosity associated with newborn stars., \n",
      " context: Herbig-Haro (HH) objects are bright patches of nebulosity associated with newborn stars. They are formed when narrow jets of partially ionised gas ejected by stars collide with nearby clouds of gas and dust at several hundred kilometres per second. Herbig-Haro objects are commonly found in star-forming regions, and several are often seen around a single star, aligned with its rotational axis. Most of them lie within about one parsec (3.26 light-years) of the source, although some have been observed several parsecs away. HH objects are transient phenomena that last around a few tens of thousands of years. They can change visibly over timescales of a few years as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds of interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM). Hubble Space Telescope observations have revealed the complex evolution of HH objects over the period of a few years, as parts of the nebula fade while others brighten as they collide with the clumpy material of the interstellar medium. First observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, Herbig-Haro objects were recognised as a distinct type of emission nebula in the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed the objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process. Although HH objects are a visible wavelength phenomena, many remain invisible at these wavelengths due to dust and gas, and can only be detected at infrared wavelengths. Such objects, when observed in near infrared, are called molecular hydrogen emission-line objects (MHOs)., \n",

Thus an atomic-scale system was shown to have intrinsically quantum properties. In the original experiment, silver atoms were sent through a spatially varying magnetic field, which deflected them before they struck a detector screen, such as a glass slide. Particles with non-zero magnetic moment are deflected, due to the magnetic field gradient, from a straight path. The screen reveals discrete points of accumulation, rather than a continuous distribution, owing to their quantized spin. Historically, this experiment was decisive in convincing physicists of the reality of angular-momentum quantization in all atomic-scale systems.After its conception by Otto Stern in 1921, the experiment was first successfully conducted by Walther Gerlach in early 1922., \n",

It was discovered firstly by mathematical physicist Albert Schwarz. It is named after mathematicians Shiing-Shen Chern and James Harris Simons, who introduced the Chern-Simons 3-form. In the Chern-Simons theory, the action is proportional to the integral of the Chern-Simons 3-form. In condensed-matter physics, Chern-Simons theory describes the topological order in fractional quantum Hall effect states. In mathematics, it has been used to calculate knot invariants and three-manifold invariants such as the Jones polynomial. Particularly, Chern-Simons theory is specified by a choice of simple Lie group known as the gauge group of the theory and also a number referred to as the level of the theory, which is a constant that multiplies the action. The action is gauge dependent, however the partition function of the quantum theory is well-defined when the level is an integer and the gauge field strength vanishes on all boundaries of the 3-dimensional spacetime. It has also been used to create topological quantum computers (TQC). Specifically, an SU(2) Chern-Simons theory describes the simplest non-abelian anyonic model of a TQC, the Yang-Lee-Fibonacci model. Its fusion rules are also described by WZW theory and conformal field theory., \n",

The errors do not need to be normal, nor do they need to be independent and identically distributed (only uncorrelated with mean zero and homoscedastic with finite variance). The requirement that the estimator be unbiased cannot be dropped, since biased estimators exist with lower variance. See, for example, the James-Stein estimator (which also drops linearity), ridge regression, or simply any degenerate estimator. The theorem was named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov, although Gauss' work significantly predates Markov's. But while Gauss derived the result under the assumption of independence and normality, Markov reduced the assumptions to the form stated above. further generalization to non-spherical errors was given by Alexander Aitken., \n",

It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current. The Biot-Savart law is fundamental to magnetostatics, playing a role similar to that of Coulomb's law in electrostatics. When magnetostatics does not apply, the Biot-Savart law should be replaced by Jefimenko's equations.

      "question: Who discovered a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord., \n",
      " context: Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common form is infantile Tay-Sachs disease which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five. Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset). These forms tend to be less severe, but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner. The mutation disrupts the activity of the enzyme, which results in the buildup of the molecule GM2 ganglioside within cells, leading to toxicity. Diagnosis may be supported by measuring the blood hexosaminidase level or genetic testing. Tay-Sachs disease is a type of GM2 gangliosidosis and sphingolipidosis.The treatment of Tay-Sachs disease is supportive in nature. This may involve multiple specialities as well as psychosocial support for the family. The disease is rare in the general population. In Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of southeastern Quebec, the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania, and the Cajuns of southern Louisiana, the condition is more common. Approximately in 3,600 Ashkenazi Jews at birth are affected.The disease is named after British ophthalmologist Waren Tay, who in 1881 first described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye; and American neurologist Bernard Sachs, who described in 1887 the cellular changes and noted an increased rate of disease in Ashkenazi Jews. Carriers of a single Tay-Sachs allele are typically normal. It has been hypothesized that being a carrier may confer protection from tuberculosis, explaining the persistence of the allele in certain populations. Researchers are looking at gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy as possible treatments., \n",

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is particularly useful in identifying conserved quantities for mechanical systems, which may be possible even when the mechanical problem itself cannot be solved completely. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is also the only formulation of mechanics in which the motion of a particle can be represented as a wave. In this sense, it fulfilled a long-held goal of theoretical physics (dating at least to Johann Bernoulli in the eighteenth century) of finding an analogy between the propagation of light and the motion of a particle. The wave equation followed by mechanical systems is similar to, but not identical with, Schrodinger's equation, as described below; for this reason, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is considered the \"closest approach\" of classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.In mathematics, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a necessary condition describing extremal geometry in generalizations of problems from the calculus of variations. It can be understood as a special case of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation from dynamic programming., \n",

      "question: Who discovered a second-order partial differential equation whose solutions are the functions for which a given functional is stationary., \n",
      " context: In the calculus of variations, the Euler equation is a second-order partial differential equation whose solutions are the functions for which a given functional is stationary. It was developed by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler and Italian mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the 1750s. Because a differentiable functional is stationary at its local extrema, the Euler-Lagrange equation is useful for solving optimization problems in which, given some functional, one seeks the function minimizing or maximizing it. This is analogous to Fermat's theorem in calculus, stating that at any point where a differentiable function attains a local extremum its derivative is zero. In Lagrangian mechanics, according to Hamilton's principle of stationary action, the evolution of a physical system is described by the solutions to the Euler equation for the action of the system. In this context Euler equations are usually called Lagrange equations. In classical mechanics, it is equivalent to Newton's laws of motion, but it has the advantage that it takes the same form in any system of generalized coordinates, and it is better suited to generalizations. In classical field theory there is an analogous equation to calculate the dynamics of a field., \n",

      " context: In condensed matter physics, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter (also called the fifth state of matter) which is typically formed when a gas of bosons at low densities is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (-273.15 degC, -459.67 degF). Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point microscopic quantum mechanical phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent macroscopically. BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density (about one-hundred-thousandth (1/100,000) the density of normal air) to ultra-low temperatures. This state was first predicted, generally, in 1924-1925 by Albert Einstein following and crediting a pioneering paper by Satyendra Nath Bose on the new field now known as quantum statistics., \n",

That is, it is in NP, and any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine to the Boolean satisfiability problem. The theorem is named after Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin. An important consequence of this theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability, then every NP problem can be solved by a deterministic polynomial time algorithm.

      "context: In linear algebra, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (named after the mathematicians Arthur Cayley and William Rowan Hamilton) states that every square matrix over a commutative ring (such as the real or complex field) satisfies its own characteristic equation. If is a given nxn matrix and In is the nxn identity matrix, then the characteristic polynomial of is defined as det where det is the determinant operation and is a variable for a scalar element of the base ring. Since the entries of the matrix are (linear or constant) polynomials in l, the determinant is also an n-th order monic polynomial in l, One can create an analogous polynomial in the matrix instead of the scalar variable l, defined as The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that this polynomial results in the zero matrix, which is to say that The theorem allows An to be expressed as a linear combination of the lower matrix powers of A. When the ring is a field, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is equivalent to the statement that the minimal polynomial of a square matrix divides its characteristic polynomial. The theorem was first proved in 1853 in terms of inverses of linear functions of quaternions, a non-commutative ring, by Hamilton. This corresponds to the special case of certain real or complex matrices. The theorem holds for general quaternionic matrices. Cayley in 1858 stated it for and smaller matrices, but only published a proof for the case. The general case was first proved by Ferdinand Frobenius in 1878., \n",
